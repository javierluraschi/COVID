"WHO has recently published a document on controlling the spread of COVID-19 at ground"
"crossings."
""
"Unlike airports and maritime ports, ground crossings often constitute informal passages"
"between two countries without a physical structure, barriers, or borders. Moreover, ground"
"crossings may contribute to the international spread of disease. Travellers and people living and"
"working on and around borders are particularly vulnerable to this threat."
""
"Some countries systematically inspect travellers, conveyances and cargo passing formal ground"
"crossings, while others allow the relatively free movement across borders, as regulated by"
"bilateral or regional agreements. The communities living on and around ground crossings vary"
"according to size and density. For many people living in these communities, cross-border"
"movement represents a daily necessity for work, trade, family visits, schooling, healthcare"
"services, religious activities, and other reasons. However, in places where national authorities"
"are unable to fully monitor formal and informal ground crossings, health measures to control"
"public health risks may be difficult to implement."
""
"The objectives of this guidance are to advise countries on how to reduce the spread of COVID-"
"19 resulting from travel, transportation, and trade on and around ground crossings by: 1)"
"Identifying priority ground crossings and communities; and 2) Scaling up preparedness and"
"control measures at these locations."
""
"This guidance has been developed in line with WHO’s Handbook for public health capacity"
"building at ground crossings and cross-border collaborations, and WHO’s global strategy to"
"respond to COVID-19. The target audience of this guidance includes: 1) the International Health"
"Regulations (IHR 2005) National Focal Points (IHR NFP); 2) authorities responsible for"
"implementing the IHR at ground crossings; 3) representatives of government and"
"nongovernmental organizations and their partners at ground crossings; and 4) public health"
"professionals involved in disease surveillance, communication, emergency preparedness and"
"response, animal health and environmental health at ground crossings and in nearby"
"communities."
""
"This guidance is divided into the following sections: identification of priority ground crossings,"
"and key preparedness activities for those crossings and nearby communities. It also covers"
"legal enforcement and planning, surveillance, interviewing and managing sick travellers with"
"suspected COVID-19, acute emergency response during mass movement across the border,"
"supplies of infection and control equipment and material, risk communication, cross border"
"collaboration, and risk monitoring and adapting health measures as trends change."
